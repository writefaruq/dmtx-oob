Intro
=====================
This app is developed to test OOB device creation and pairing using data matrix symbol 

Assuming that dmtx symbol contains oob data as eir tag  in a predefined xml format this app can:
- decode the symbol into text/xml file
- parse oob data from that file
- make a call to Bluez Adapter interface to create a paired OOB device
- report status

Usage/Testing Guidelines
==========================
1. Create a data matrix symbol of local OOB data by running this script:
$ cd /path/to/dmtx-oob/
$ ./create-symbol.sh hciX (Replace X by the OOB capable adapter number such as 0 or 1 ...)

2. Transfer the output of this script oob-symbol.png file to remote OOB host machine using network, usb etc.
to remote /path/to/dmtx-oob/
3. Run this app using remote symbol
$ src/dmtxoob ./oob-symbol.png
